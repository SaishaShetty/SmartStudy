Boosting Student Learning with RAG-Powered Insights

Baseline Model : Using ChatGPT 4 we are going to compare the results with our two proposed models.

1. Worked on a "Retrieve-then-Generate" RAG pipeline using Langchain and GPT-4 Model
2. Worked on a "Retrieve-then-Generate" RAG pipeline using LLAMA Model
3. Worked on a "Hybrid" RAG pipeline using Langchain and GPT-4 Model


GPT-4 Model :

Trained on 8billion parameters. 
Look out for hallucinations.
BLEU Score

LLAMA-3 Model :

Trained on ?  parameters. 
Look out for hallucinations.
BLEU Score


Future Work: ?
1. Better RAG pipelines to check out. (DPR)
2. We do not have the computational strength to train some.
